								<h4>Food Allergy</h4> 
								<p>	Food allergy is an immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways.</p>
								<p>	Food allergy affects an estimated 6 to 8 percent of children under age 3 and up to 3 percent of adults. While there's no cure, some children outgrow their food allergy as they get older.</p>

								<h4>Parvovirus infection</h4>
								<p>	Parvovirus infection is a common and highly contagious childhood illness. It's sometimes called slapped-cheek disease because of the distinctive face rash that develops. </p>
								<p>	Parvovirus infection has also been known as fifth disease because, historically, it was fifth in a list of common childhood illnesses characterized by a rash.</p>

								<h4>Ringworm (scalp)</h4> 
								<p>	Ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis) is a fungal infection of the scalp and hair shafts. The signs and symptoms of ringworm of the scalp may vary, but it usually appears as itchy, scaly, bald patches on the head.</p>
								<p>	Ringworm of the scalp, a highly contagious infection, is most common in toddlers and school-age children.</p>

							<div class="col-sm">
								<h4> Heat rash</h4>
								<p>	Heat rash — also known as prickly heat and miliaria — isn't just for babies. It affects adults, too, especially during hot, humid weather.</p>
								<p>	Heat rash develops when blocked pores (sweat ducts) trap perspiration under your skin.</p>

								<h4>Impetigo</h4> 
								<p>	Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and children. Impetigo usually appears as red sores on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth, and on hands and feet. The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts.</p>
								
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm">
								<h4>Diaper rash</h4>
								<p>	Diaper rash is a common form of inflamed skin (dermatitis) that appears as a patchwork of bright red skin on your baby's bottom.</p>
								<p>	Diaper rash is often related to wet or infrequently changed diapers, skin sensitivity, and chafing. It usually affects babies, though anyone who wears a diaper regularly can develop the condition.</p>
